Recommendation Systems
With the increasing need for e-commerce plotforms, recommendation systems have become increasingly important.
Companies such as Netflix and Amazon use recommendation systems to offer content that will appeal to customers' needs and interests. For example, the recommended movies when
we want to watch movies on Netflix. When we visit the e-commerce site to buy a product, suggestions such as those who bought this product also bought them.
There are numerous recommendations similar to these ingredients. We'll take a look at how these events happen with recommendation systems

Association Rule Learning Recommender
Association Rule Learning (Arl), performs analysis with the data held by a company. As a result of these analyzes, they perform future-oriented behaviors by deducing
the association rules in the data. For example, let's say we've added a product to our cart. At the same time, we may come across different product recommendations.
Here's how these recommendations came about. The product that we buy and the product that is most bought and that has a relationship is seen.

Collaborative Filtering
This filtering method usually relies on collecting and analyzing information about the user's behavior, activities or preferences and predicting what they will like based on
their similarity with other users. E.g; If a customer has watched movies X, Y and Z, and a different user has watched movies Y, Z and W, these two users can watch movies that 
they have not watched due to similar viewings. The collaborative filtering method is based on this example. We will consider the Item-Based and User-Based recommendation systems
with the collaborative filtering method.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Item-Based collaborative filtering refers to the habits of liking products. With any movie, the movie with the highest correlation is recommended by finding movies
that show similar behavior to that movie.

User-Based Collaborative Filtering
User-Based Collaborative Filtering, a recommendation system is developed over a user who has similar liking behavior and watched the same movies as the user to whom advice is
requested. For example, let's say users A and B. Let a user watch 12 movies. Let's assume that user B watched 10 of the movies A watched and gave similar scores.
When B wants to watch a new movie, I can recommend movies that user A hasn't watched.
